- Full validation and sanitization

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Brevo Account

1. Go to [Brevo.com](https://www.brevo.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Get API Key

1. Log in to your Brevo dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** → **SMTP & API**
3. Click on **API Keys** tab
4. Click **Generate a new API key**
5. Give it a name (e.g., "GARI Website")
6. Copy the API key (you won't be able to see it again!)

### 3. Create Contact Lists

1. Go to **Contacts** → **Lists**
2. Create two lists:
   - **Newsletter Subscribers** (will be List ID: 2)
   - **Contact Form Submissions** (will be List ID: 3)
3. Note down the List IDs (you can find them in the URL when viewing a list)

### 4. Verify Sender Email

1. Go to **Settings** → **Senders & IP**
2. Add and verify your sender email domain
3. For testing, you can use Brevo's default sender
4. For production, verify your own domain (e.g., noreply@gari.team)

### 5. Configure Vercel Environment Variables

#### Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your project on [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following variable:
   - **Name**: `BREVO_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Brevo API key (from step 2)
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development (select all)
5. Click **Save**

#### Option B: Via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
npm i -g vercel

# Link your project
vercel link

# Add environment variable
vercel env add BREVO_API_KEY
# Paste your API key when prompted
# Select: Production, Preview, Development
```

### 6. Update List IDs (if different)

If your Brevo list IDs are different from 2 and 3, update them in:

**File**: `api/send-email.js`

```javascript
// Line ~120 - Newsletter list
listIds: [2], // Change to your newsletter list ID

// Line ~280 - Contact form list
listIds: [3], // Change to your contact form list ID
```

### 7. Update Lead Member Email (if needed)

To change the lead member email from bc833498@gmail.com:

**File**: `api/send-email.js`

Search for `bc833498@gmail.com` and replace with your email address (appears 3 times).

### 8. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

Or push to your GitHub repository if you have automatic deployments set up.
